        <h2>The Coffee Corner Story</h2>
        <div class="story-content-full">
          <p>
            With over 15 years of experience in the coffee world, Liz has
            perfected the art of sourcing, roasting, and brewing exquisite coffees. Starting her journey in
            a small cafe in Seattle, she learned the importance of using only the
            finest, ethically sourced beans.
          </p>
          <p>
            After working with some of the most prestigious roasters across the country, she
            returned home with a dream: to create the perfect cup of coffee that would bring joy
            to every customer's day.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Coffee Corner opened its doors in 2018 with a simple mission: to brew the most
            delicious and high-quality coffee for our community. What started as a small neighborhood coffee cart has grown into a beloved destination, but we've never forgotten our roots.
          </p>
           <p>
              Every cup that leaves our counter is a testament to our commitment to excellence. We guarantee that every ingredient, from start to finish, maintains the highest standards of quality, and we treat every customer like family.
